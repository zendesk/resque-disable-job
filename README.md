# Resque::Disable::Job

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/zendesk/resque-disable-job.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/zendesk/resque-disable-job)


This is a Resque plugin that allows us to disable jobs from being processed, by using the job class name and arguments.
It uses some Redis data structures to keep a record of what jobs need to be disabled and how many jobs were disabled for that rule.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'resque-disable-job'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install resque-disable-job

## Usage

### Job
You can add it to your job like any other Resque plugin:

```ruby
  class TestJob
    extend Resque::Plugins::DisableJob
    @queue = :test

    def self.perform(some_id, other_id)
    end
  end
```
The plugin will add the `before_perform_allow_disable_job` Resque hook. This will check if the current job needs to be stopped and it calls the `disable_job_handler` method.
By default this will just raise `Resque::Job::DontPerform`. If you want to do more you can override it in your job or base class.

### Disabling a Job

In your application's console you can use the `Resque::Plugins::DisableJob::Job.disable_job` method to disable a job.

`Resque::Plugins::DisableJob::Job.disable_job(job_name, matching_arguments, ttl = 3600)`

Note: By default, each rule has a ttl of 1 hour. This is because disabling a job should be a temporary action.

```ruby
# Disable all the jobs of that class:
TestJob.disable
# Disable all TestJob jobs with the first argument `65` 
TestJob.disable([65])
# Disable all SampleJob jobs that have the argument a == 5
SampleJob.disable({a: 5})

# Disable a job for one hour
SampleJob.disable({a: 1}, 3600)

# Re-enable jobs:
TestJob.enable()
TestJob.enable([65])

# Simple kill-switch to remove all the rules for the job
TestJob.enable_all

# Kill-switch to remove all the jobs and their rules
Resque::Plugins::DisableJob::Job.enable_all!
```

**Note**: You can disable many arguments for one job type, but for performance reasons we look at only 10 rules.

### Operations

`Resque::Plugins::DisableJob::Stats` comes with a a few methods that will help you keep track of actively disabled jobs and how many times the rule was matched. 
They all return an `Array[Resque::Plugins::DisableJob::Rule]`.

* `all_disabled_jobs` - a list of all the disabled jobs and their rules
* `job_disabled_rules(job_name)` - a list of all the rules for one particular job 
* `disabled_stats` - all the disabled jobs, their rules, and the counter of how many times it was matched (the `Rule` objects have the `counter` attribute set)  

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
