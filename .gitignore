## Environment normalization:
# for a library or gem, you might want to ignore these files since the code is
# intended to run in multiple environments; otherwise, check them in:
Gemfile.lock
.ruby-version
# unless supporting rvm < 1.11.0 or doing something fancy, ignore this:

# Exclude the built gems
*.gem
